# early-ai-project

ðŸ§  A completely white-box Decision Tree Classifier built from scratch in NumPy.

This project was an early experiment in explainable AI â€” no scikit-learn, no shortcuts, just pure logic.

It features:
- Gini impurity calculation
- Information gain-based splits
- Custom tree construction
- Printable tree traversal
- No hidden layers. No magic functions.

Every line of logic is traceable. Every decision can be audited.

Built as a foundation for what became [Wh0Dini-AI](https://github.com/M1ztick/Wh0Dini-AI), this project embodies the same principle: *open, understandable, ethical AI development.*
